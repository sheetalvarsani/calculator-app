# Calculator App

A simple and responsive calculator built using **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, and **HTML**. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a clean, modern interface and handles multiple sequential operations.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Clear (`AC`) and delete (`DEL`) buttons for resetting or modifying input.
- Support for decimal numbers.
- Real-time display updates for each button press.
- Prevents invalid inputs like multiple operators in sequence (e.g., `++`, `--`, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better maintainability of the code.
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the calculator interface.
- **SCSS**: Used for styling the app with responsiveness and modular CSS practices.
